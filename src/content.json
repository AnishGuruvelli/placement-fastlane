      "problem": "Students put in effort—completing modules, projects, and sessions—but often assume course completion guarantees a job. In reality, they also need mocks, DSA prep, and smart applications. Without a clear view of progress or which roles to focus on, many feel lost or apply to every job without strategy.",

      "friction": "I think I’d do better if I’m in a pod with folks at my level—or slightly above. That way, we can discuss questions, review solutions, and grow together. As they say, you become like the 5 people you’re surrounded by.",

      "friction": "I’m putting in effort to help the community, but there’s no tangible result from that—so I often feel like I might as well just focus on my own work.",
